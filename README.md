The Open Model Interface (OMI) is a spec for _multi-platform_ OCI-compatible container images for Machine Learning models.

## Rationale
The Open Model Interface is designed to serve as a spec for wrapping models in OCI-compliant containers with a simple yet powerful interface that standardizes on certain security best practices, supports the widest range of machine learning and artificial intelligence training tools and frameworks, and enables re-use of existing integration code to add new or updated models to production environments by sharing a common API across all model containers.
