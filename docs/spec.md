## Requirements

To qualify as an Open Model Interface (OMI) compliant container, a container must pass the following tests.

### OCI compliant

The container image MUST be an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compliant container image, for example it MAY be generated by [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) or [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko).

### Origin tags

The container MUST be tagged (e.g. `tag` in `registry/org/image:tag`) with a unique ID which corresponds to the ID of the model in the upstream model management system.
For example, the container image tag MAY be set to the [MLflow Run ID](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html) which generated the model.

This is to enable provenance tracking from a given model which generated certain inference results to metadata about how the model was trained.
The metadata referred to by the model tag SHOULD record the versions of the code, data and environment that were used to train the model.

### Environment variables
Starting with Version 1.1 Environment variables have been replaced with [OCI annotations](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md) to ensure that an OMI compliant container always returns the same information when metadata is queried at rest and at runtime.


### Declares Openmodel Annotations

The container MUST have [OCI annotations](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md) of the following form:

```
ml.openmodel.interfaces=["kfserving", "modzy"]
ml.openmodel.protocols=[["v1","v2"],["v2"]]
ml.openmodel.port="8080"
ml.openml.model_name="modelname"
```

Where `ml.openmodel.protocol` is list of lists such that the inner list's index corresponds to its interface index e.g. a model with the above configuration would support kfserving v1 and v2 protocols as well as the modzy interface with v2 protocol.

This is so that the serving system at runtime can determine whether it supports a given model without trying to run it so that it can give the user fast feedback.

### Ports

When started, the container image MUST listen on the TCP port given as the `ml.openmodel.port` annotation.
When a container starts listening on the prescribed port, it MUST adhere to the interface described below corresponding to its configuration.

### Interfaces and Protocols

The following interfaces are permitted in the spec:

* `kfserving`: Supports
  * [v1 REST API](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/blob/master/docs/README.md#data-plane-v1) with `ml.openmodel.interfaces=["kfserving"] and ml.openmodel.protocols="v1" `
  * [v2 gRPC API](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2) with `ml.openmodel.interfaces=["kfserving"] and ml.openmodel.protocols="v2"`
* `modzy`: Supports 
  * [v1 REST API](https://docs.modzy.com/docs/container-specifications-rest) with `ml.openmodel.interfaces=["modzy"] and ml.openmodel.protocols="v1" `
  * [v2 gRPC API](https://docs.modzy.com/docs/container-specifications-grpc) with `ml.openmodel.interfaces=["modzy"] and ml.openmodel.protocols="v2" `


OMI compliant container images MUST: 
  * implement at least one of the `kfserving` or `modzy` API interfaces
  * be runnable and responsive on both KServe and Modzy platforms
  * be runnable independently in isolation

For example:

The [Chassis](https://chassis.ml) reference implementation of the OMI specification produces containers 
  * that implement the `modzy.v2` API. 
  * that implement a KServe compatible architecture that follows the `kfserving.v1` specification with one exception. Chassis generated model containers expect binary data instead of the json data the `kfserving.v1` spec designates. However, python can interpret binary data as text. As a result the model containers will run on both KFServing and Modzy Platforms.
  * that can run in isolation

## Updates to this spec

If an OMI image declares or supports any strings other than the ones defined above, this document MUST be updated with the new interfaces (with links to their upstream protocol specifications), otherwise the container MUST NOT be described as Open Model Interface compliant.

This document can be updated via Pull Request on [GitHub](https://github.com/modzy/openmodelinterface/edit/main/docs/spec.md).

Any proposed PRs must be accompanied by a public comment period of no less than 2 weeks (14 days) before a merge can be approved.
